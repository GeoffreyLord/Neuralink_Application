Hash and send:
- Create a profile for every possible outcome. Hash the file -> send -> each sum corresponds to a profile
- Turn bytes to ints, and devide
    - Keep deviding by numbers 1-9 until you reach a number which has a finite value, i.e. non repeating.



- Need a function that is continuous but can be represented by a product of two numbers.


- What if I were able to make classes of chaotic integers that are seemingmy not repeating. like pi and the compression algorithm is jsut a search algorithm that searches
through the chaotic ints and says use this chaotic int and look at index 10-20. The question is if the indexes will ever be less than the data being selected. 
- Think about what sammy camcar did with the garage door cracking script about how they could jusr roll the keys
